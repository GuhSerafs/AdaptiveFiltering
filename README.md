# AdaptiveFiltering
Jupyter Notebooks from the Adaptive Filtering classes that I took in the Federal University of ABC. In the classes I learned about the following algorithms: 
* Least Mean Squares (LMS)
* Recursive Least Squares (RLS)
With those algorithms we developed a few filter examples, like Wiener Filters, Predictor Filters, Kalman Filters and more.
